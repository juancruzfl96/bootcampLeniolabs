						<h1>TONY STARK</h1>
						<p class="data">
							Anthony Edward Stark known as Tony Stark, a billionaire<br />
							American business mogul, playboy and ingenious scientist,<br />
							who suffered a serious chest injury during a kidnapping.<br />
							When his captors try to force him to build a weapon of<br />
							mass destruction instead he creates armor to save his life<br />
							and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops the suit for him,<br />
							adding weapons and other technological devices that he designed
							to<br />
							through his company, Stark Industries. He wears the suit and<br />
							successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man.<br />
							initially concealed his true identity, Stark finally declared<br />
							that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.<br />

						I chose Tony Stark (Ironman) among all the Avengers, because he<br />
						always showed the image that he didn't care about anyone but
						himself.<br />
						The lustful, self-centered image of him made everyone think about
						it<br />
						and at the end of a great saga (which still continues), he decides
						to give<br />
						his life for all the people him care about and the rest people in
						the world.<br />
						For me he is the best of all, he did not have any super power,<br />
						just a lot of money.
