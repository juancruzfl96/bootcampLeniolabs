						I chose Tony Stark (Ironman) among all the Avengers, because he
						always showed the image that he didn't care about anyone but
						himself. The lustful, self-centered image of him made everyone think
						about it and at the end of a great saga (which still continues), he
						decides to give his life for all the people him care about and the
						rest people in the world. For me he is the best of all, he did not
						have any super power, just a lot of money.
